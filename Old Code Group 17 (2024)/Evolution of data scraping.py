# The following code adds a few changes namely :
#
# -Added some basic docstrings
#
# -Added comments
#
# -Added some error checking
#
# -Some performance improvement (using re.compile although not very important)
#
# -Errors now handled by logging rather than printing
#
# -If directory not found, continues processing, rather than simply stopping
#
# -Replaced the itertools.groupby with defaultdict(list), did some research and is apparently more robust a function to use.
#
# -Add what file isnâ€™t found  when catching and reporting the errors
#
# -After making JSON, set ensure_ascii = False to ensure we maintain the original characters.
